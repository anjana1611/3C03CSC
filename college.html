        <center>
        <p id="para">Early in <i>1964</i>, the enlightened public of Kanhangad and Nileshwar resolved to honour the memory of <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b>, the architect of modern India by undertaking educational and cultural activities in this educationally backward area. In pursuit of this idea, a dedicated and learned team set up in <i>1966</i>, an educational society known as <b>"The Nehru Memorial Education Society"</b> under the distinguished presidentship of the <b>late Shri. C. K. Nair</b> following which the society was duly registered. The establishment of <b>Nehru Arts & Science College, Kanhangad</b> in this backward coastal tract was the major task the society had set before themselves and had subsequently accomplished it.
