      The film is the story of Rajeevan, an advocate and Nandita Menon, a writer. Rajeevan is married to Rekha, a bank employee, and has two kids. Nandita is married to Mukundan (Siddique), a businessman in the Gulf, and has a daughter. Both meet each other accidentally and in due course their relationship becomes intimate. Their tastes and thinking are almost alike. Megha Malhar movie tells Nandita (Samyuktha Varma) who is a budding writer who works with a leading newspaper and Rajeev (Biju Menon) an attorney. They lead their normal family life happily. A mix-up in the cakes they ordered for their respective kids introduce the protagonists and their background.

Then they meet again, and again. When Rajeev narrates an incident in his childhood bearing uncanny resemblance to Nandita’s short story, she realizes he is her childhood friend on whose shoulders she leaned on in times of distress.

A chemistry develops between them and Rajeev mistakes this to be love and expresses his feelings to her. She responds predictably and tries to alienate him, ignoring him. But later she gifts her book "Megha Malhar" to him, revealing that she is his childhood friend.

Rajeev agrees never to meet her afterwards and meet her for the last time. They travel together to Kanyakumari where they had spent their childhood together and they decide to part their ways and live as strangers.
